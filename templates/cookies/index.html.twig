    To make the websites of the Publications Office of the European Union work properly, we sometimes place small data files called ‘cookies’ on your device.

    What are cookies?

    A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
    {# Describes what cookies are and how they work #}

    First-party cookies are cookies set by the website you’re visiting. Only that website can read them. In addition, a website might potentially use external services, which also set their own cookies, known as third-party cookies.
    Persistent cookies are cookies that are saved on your computer and are not deleted automatically when you quit your browser, unlike a session cookie, which is deleted when you quit your browser.
    {# Explains the difference between first-party and third-party cookies, as well as persistent and session cookies #}

    Every time you visit the Publications Office’s websites, you will be prompted to accept or refuse cookies.
    {# Informs the user that they will be prompted to accept or refuse cookies when visiting the website #}

    How do we use cookies?

    The Publications Office websites mostly use ‘first-party cookies’. These are cookies set and controlled by the Publications Office, not by any external organisations.

    However, to view some of our pages, you will have to accept cookies from external organisations.

    You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that, some features of this site may not work as intended. These cookies are used to remember:
